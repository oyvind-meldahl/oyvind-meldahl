### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ’¬ My name is Ã˜yvind, and I am a student at Noroff - School of technology and digital media. I am studying front-end development!

ğŸŒ± I am currently finishing my first of two years of school.

ğŸ˜„ I feel confident in html, css and js, but still have a way to go before I can call myself an expert.

ğŸ”­ In addition to the languages mentioned above, I am looking into leaning Python.
